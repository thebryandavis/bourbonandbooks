# Bourbon & Books ðŸ“šðŸ¥ƒ

Welcome to Bourbon & Books! bourbonandbooks.com This project is a fun little thing, inspired from a book club with friends back in New Orleans. We loved pairing great reads with delicious bourbons, and I wanted to bring that idea here.

The purpose of the to app helps you discover new books and suggests a perfect bourbon pairing to go along with your reading journey. Whether you're a seasoned bookworm, a bourbon aficionado, or just looking for a unique way to enjoy both, you've come to the right place!

Explore new genres, find your next favorite book, and maybe even discover a new bourbon to sip while you read.

Cheers to good books and great bourbons!
